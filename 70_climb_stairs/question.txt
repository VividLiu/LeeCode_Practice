	u are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.

	Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

	
	Thinking:
	Use example to illustrate the problem.
	When n = 3, the set of ways is: [1,1,1],   [2, 1], [1, 2]
	When n = 4, the set of ways is: [1,1,1,1],   [2,1,1], [1,2,1], [1,1,2],   [2,2] 	
	when n = 5, the set of ways is: [1,1,1,1,1],   [2,1,1,1], [1,2,1,1], [1,1,2,1], [1,1,1,2],   [2,2,1], [2,1,2], [1,2,2]

	When the abstract problem are illustrated using specific number as example, it is easier to find the correaltion.

	Assume S(n) is the solution for n, and we know all the solutions before n, then we can conclude the formula for this question.
	S(n) = S(n-1) + S(n-1), typical Fibonacci question.

	It make sense to apply the thinking back to the question. 
	Since we can only take 1 or 2 steps each time, the final step to reach n stairs can either be 1 or 2. Thus, the number of ways to 
	reach nth stair are the sum of the number of ways to reach (n-2)th stair then take 2 step and the number of ways to reach (n-1)th
	stair and take 1 step.
