260. Single Number III
    Given an array of numbers nums, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once.

    For example:

    Given nums = [1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 5], return [3, 5].

    Note:
    The order of the result is not important. So in the above example, [5, 3] is also correct.
    Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant space complexity?

    The question mentioned that only two elements appeared once and all the rest elements appreared exactly twice. There are some information here we know are keys to solve the problem, 1). only two elements. 2). the rest appeared once.
    Thus, if we can find a way to cancel out the same numbers first, the result is going to be the different two elements. Then we need a way to separate out these two elements.
