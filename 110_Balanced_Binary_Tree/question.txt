110.Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as:

a binary tree in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1.

Example 1:
        3
      /   \
    9      20
         /    \
       15      7

Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: true 

Example 2: 
        1
      /   \
     2     2
   /   \
  3     3
 / \
4   4

Input: root = [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]
Output: false

Example 3: 
Input: root = []
Output: true
