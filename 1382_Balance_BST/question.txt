1382. Balance a Binary Search Tree

Given the root of a binary search tree, return a balanced binary search tree with the same node values. If there is more than one answer, return any of them.

A binary search tree is balanced if the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than 1.

Example: 

1                2                3
 \              / \              / \
  2            1   3     or     1   4
   \    =>          \            \
    3                4            2
     \
      4
